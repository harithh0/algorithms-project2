## Analyzing Sorting Algorithms' Efficiency

It's often said that "time is money," emphasizing the importance of using time efficiently. Why waste time using slow sorting algorithms? This project addresses this by examining and analyzing four different sorting algorithms to determine their time complexity, enabling you to avoid inefficient sorting methods.

The four algorithms investigated are:

* Bubble Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Radix Sort

We compared the time these algorithms took to sort data in their worst-case, average-case, and best-case scenarios. Each scenario involved sorting datasets of 100 numbers, 1,000 numbers, and 10,000 numbers. This analysis aimed to determine their time complexity and identify the best and worst performers.

## Project Goal 

The efficiency of sorting algorithms is evaluated based on their asymptotic time complexity, which defines how their runtime scales with increasing input size. Understanding these complexities is essential for selecting the most suitable sorting algorithm for various applications.

This project aims to design and implement a test suite that empirically analyzes the computational performance of four sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Radix Sort. The goal is to verify their asymptotic time complexities in the best, worst, and average-case scenarios by collecting and analyzing runtime data.
